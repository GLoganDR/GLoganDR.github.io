Ideally, I would be working with the MEAN stack and JavaScript, but I would be willing to learn other languges as necessary. I want to get a good full-stack or back-end job as a junior developer. Making games and mobile apps would also be very fun. I also intend to create my own website soon called bandmade.org.</p><h3 class="about-us-title">Education</h3><p>I was a journalism major and creative writing/French minor at EIU in Charleston, IL. I attended Nashville Software School in Nashville, TN to learn software development via their 6-month bootcamp.</p><h3 class="about-us-title">Brief Background</h3><p>I was born and raised in Illinois in the middle of the state surrounded by farmland and a mid-sized forest. I didn't get my first computer until the age of 14 in 2001. I quickly learned how to take care of software/hardware issues, and I became more and more "techy" as time went on. My family wanted me to go into Development then, but I was too nervous to do it. For 6 years, I was a vocalist for a couple of touring acts. I decided to hang up the mic for a career recently. I took a year of C++ in computer sciences class in high school, and my interest was piqued then. I recently decided to follow through with Development because I wanted to feel like I was proud of my work. I love the feeling of seeing my code come to life and watching something build on itself.</p><h3 class="about-us-title">My Blog</h3><p><a href="http://medium.com/@loganrichardson" class="fa fa-rocket">&nbsp; Medium.com</a></p></div><div id="about-sidebar" class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-12 right-effect right"></div></div><!--End content-wrapper --></div></section>
