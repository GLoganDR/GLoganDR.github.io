          | I would like to secure a great position with a company where I can be proud of my work. Ideally, I would be working with the MEAN stack and JavaScript, but I would be willing to learn other languages as necessary, of course. I want to get a good front-end or back-end job as a junior developer, I like both equally and can see myself furthering my ability on either end. Making games and mobile apps would also be very fun.

          | I was a journalism major and creative writing/French minor at EIU in Charleston, IL. I attended Nashville Software School in Nashville, TN to learn software development via their 6-month bootcamp.
         h3.about-us-title Brief Background
        p
          | I was born and raised in Illinois in the middle of the state surrounded by farmland and a mid-sized forest. I didn't get my first computer until the age of 14 in 2001. I quickly learned how to take care of software/hardware issues, and I became more and more "techy" as time went on. My family wanted me to go into Development then, but I was too nervous to do it. For 6 years, I was a vocalist for a couple of touring acts. I decided to hang up the mic for a career recently. I took a year of C++ in computer sciences class in high school, and my interest was piqued then. I recently decided to follow through with Development because I wanted to feel like I was proud of my work. I love the feeling of seeing my code come to life and watching something build on itself.
